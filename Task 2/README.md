# The Fun and Easy Project: Guess the Number

This is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer. The game involves the following steps:

1. The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100.
2. The user is prompted to enter their guess in a displayed dialogue box.
3. The computer then informs the user if the entered number matches the generated number, or if it is higher or lower than the generated number.
4. The game continues until the user guesses the number correctly.
